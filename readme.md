## Style

c_x = class (use classes for more general data structures. ones that have member functions, hold advanced vectors / arrays, and require
intense manipulation for proper functionality)
x_t = struct (use these for basic type'd data structures, data structures consisting of ints, floats, chars, maybe another basic data structure
can also be incorporated)
var_name = for basic variable names
using this is very important inside of my code to distinguish between local / global scope and class member scope
keep function calls concise and neat
any sort of recommendations to optimize certain things are always fine to discuss as a team.
any sort of fatal errors should be prefixed with "FATAL ERROR !!!!" then the message you want to put inside of that error
never use any namespaces for neatness
standard library is always welcome to be used if desired.
